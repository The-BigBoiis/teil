<p class="text">
On an ominous cold morning, this little tale begins.<br />
In a small house, that could be considered fairly normal here on the outskirts of the city. It starts here in this crappy, barely standing two-story house, where a carpenters’ family lives.
<br />
<br />
<span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span>, the carpenters’ son wakes up, as the first sunbeams enter through numerous cracks and holes lighting the room. Still tired he forces himself to stand up. Unlike his siblings he has his own room, as he’s the only one with income. In this cramped room with only enough place for a bed and dresser,he takes a sip from a small bowl filled with water, washes himself with it and puts on a few simple clothes. <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> then opens the window in his room facing an alley, tosses the remaining water and covers it again. 
<br />
<br />
Time to wake up the siblings, he thinks as he enters the room next to his. Strangely they were already up and probably downstairs. Quite unusual as the always sleep in, but more importantly they left their window open. Annoyed he closes it, already thinking about how to punish them, as he told them countless times already. Looking around, it seems like he has to their room again, if he didn’t want them to get hit again. Minutes later standing in an orderly room, <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> seems quite pleased with himself, almost forgetting he has to punish them later. Now just as he’s leaving the room he notices something.
<br />
<br />
Isn’t it too quiet?<br />
After all there are fifteen people living under the same roof here. Perturbed he checks the other rooms but everyone already left. Confused he walks down the stairs, as he asks himself, if he could maybe have missed something. Reaching the bottom he picks up on a faint smell, the smell becomes stronger every step he takes towards the dining table. Coming around the corner now standing right in front of the dining-table he freezes, eyes wide in shock.
<br />
<br />
The whole family is gathered but no one is moving even an inch. The people are frozen in place, he could see his father sitting next to the uncle, usually they would be constantly arguing over the most unimportant things, now sitting quietly next to each other their faces filled with horror. <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> could see his harsh but fair grandmother, sitting there with her face distorted from horror. He could see his little sister, usually the purest thing in the world, but now frozen in place, tears rolling down her face.
<br /> 
But the worst of all, his younger brother, the one who could always cheer <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> up no matter what happened, lying there on the table, mutilated, covered in blood, missing e few patches of flesh, as if a wild animal was feasting on him. 
<br />
<br />
And then <span title=”Joestar”>Josephs</span> mother, standing on the other side of the table, completely covered in blood, chewing on a chewy piece of meat, clearly enjoying herself. The monster who caused this, undoubtedly, at this thought, <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> couldn’t hold it back any more. He bent over and puked all over the table. After straightening up he could feel mothers bloodshed eyes focusing on him, causing him to petrify. The mother puts on a wide and terrifying grin, as she slowly walks around the table towards him. Her eyes were resembling a hawks’ preying a mouse. As she almost reaches him, <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> panicked completely, causing him to regain control over his body. He turns around and runs as fast as he possibly can. While running towards the entrance door he takes a deep breath and on top of his lungs he screams:”Help!”. Just shy of reaching the door <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> could hear something behind him, but he couldn’t care less, almost there. As his hand reaches the doorknob, he could pick up a whirling sound, followed by something heavy hitting his head. His vision started spinning and before he could realize he hit the floor. Desperately he tries to stand up, but as he sees his mothers grin widen even more, he looses all his strength, causing his limbs to give in. Now lying there defenselessly and defeated, he accepts his fate, tears start flowing and he starts to visibly shake. His mother moves closer clearly enjoying every moment. Reaching <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span>, overcome by insatiable hunger she throws herself onto him slashing wildly with claw like nails. Then she proceeds to take bites of his flesh. Experiencing all this accompanied by agonizing pain his consciousness starts to fade. The last thing he sees before his vision completely fades, people armed with swords and spears rushing in through the front door. Then after all this his vision finally turns black.
</p>


<p class="text">
[A bit later]
</p>


<p class="text">
People gathered around the building, most of them onlookers, some to pay their respects, some to do their job. A priest holding a sermon, some holding the crowd at bay. A certain man pushes through the crowd, impolitely shoving people aside. As the woman could see him, she started waving.</p>
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker">-</p>    <p class="speach">“Isaac!”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
The man walking straight towards her pushed the last guy out of his way.
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Hey (Olivia), so whats going on?”</p>
    <p class="speaker">Olivia:</p>  <p class="speach">“The usual, we have 4 people dead, the rest still petrified”</p>
    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Yeah, was already asking myself when the next would happen. Just show me the scene.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Entering the Building they were immediately greeted by the stench of blood and vomit. Isaac takes out a handkerchief and covers mouth and nose. He proceeds to check the scene, a young man next to the door, a woman covered in blood, beheaded lying on the floor.
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p>   <p class="speach">“A damn shame, looks like the boy could recover from the shock in time. Would have made for an excellent guard.”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Figured that much. According to the people outside at the time, he could even scream for help.”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Order someone to take his corpse, also don’t forget this woman.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Isaac continued. Inspecting the scene at the dinner table. Everyone still frozen in place, almost as if time stopped. Inspecting each person individually he starts with <span title=”Joestar”>Josephs</span> father. He begins with checking for a pulse, breath and other signs of life.
</p>

<div class="spoken">

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“What can you tell me about this man?”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“He seems to be a well known carpenter around here, yet not really able to secure large 			amounts of money. He and his family are well respected around here, as they often help out for almost free.”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Whats wrong?”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Nothing, lets just get through with the others.”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Understood. The next man is his brother, working where he can but barely earning enough to provide for himself. He’s known for being the less successful one.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
After checking for any signs of life, Isaac continues to the grandmother. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“No reason to waste time on her, declare her death.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Then he checks <span title=”Joestar”>Josephs</span> little sister. Again looking for signs of life, he gets absorbed in his thoughts. After a few seconds he checks the little girls face, having made up his mind about something. He raises his hand and with all his strength he slaps her face. After waiting a few moments without perceiving any signs of movement he sighs.
</p>

<div class="spoken">

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Olivia”, pay attention to this child, if she wakes up then good for her, if not…<br /> Then just let her be. I guess I should inspect the rest of the house.”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“What about the ones you didn’t check?”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Isn’t it obvious? Let them be.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
He then goes into the kitchen. Besides somewhat nice furniture, he couldn’t find anything useful. Searching through the drawers, he eventually comes across a small knife made of iron. He takes it and hastily puts it away in his pocket. Everything else is just worthless junk, some clay pots, some dirty and worn cloth. 
<br />
<br />
Isaac returns to the now busy Olivia ordering her underlings around.
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p>   <p class="speach">“The kitchen is fine, take everything you deem as useful.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Isaac goes up the stairs and looks around a bit, but couldn’t find anything worth some coins. After checking every room the only thing he could find was a poorly made plush in the kids’ bedroom. But he still had to check the woman’s room. He enters to a mess of a habitable room. She probably woke up after the others, messed up the room for some reason and went downstairs for her breakfast. He starts searching around.
After almost half an hour he could confirm his suspicion. He found it, a small translucent stone.
</p>

<div class="spoken">

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“You are quite the rare one ain’t ya?”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Taking the stone, shaped like a perfect cube, small enough to fit in someones palm, he puts it in a small bag and hides it in his pocket.<br />
Now finished with his task he goes down to Olivia.
</p>

<div class="spoken">

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“My job’s done. Salvage everything you can and then burn this damn building down.”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Olivia:</p>	<p class="speach">“What about the people?”</p>

    <p class="speaker">Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“If no one recovers just let them sit there and let the family burn to ashes.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
May their souls rest in peace.
