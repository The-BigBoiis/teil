<p class="text">
On this ominous, cold and dark morning, young man’s tragic destiny unfolds. In a small town encircled by its walls, protected from the outside world, stands a house on the city’s outskirts. In that cheap, barely standing two-story house, <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span>, a novice carpenter lives with his family. He begins his day, waking up in his small bedroom with barely enough place for bed and dresser. The room slowly brightens, as sunbeams enter through numerous cracks and holes, <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> gave up on fixing a long time ago. <br /><br />
He calmly does his morning routine, still freezing from the coldness the night brought residing in the room. He picks up a bowl filled with fresh water from a nearby well, takes a sip and washes himself with it. <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> opens the only window in his room, basically a big hole in the wall covered by scrap wood, instantly light floods the room blinding <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> for a moment by doing so. After sneezing and almost spilling the water contained in the small bowl made of clay, he tosses the remaining bit out of the window. After placing it on the dresser and putting on his simple clothes he concludes his morning routine. About to exit his room a smile forms on <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span>s face, as he remembers his finally getting his first set of metal tools. <br /><br />
He knocks on the door next to his. No response. Just as he expected, his younger siblings always sleep in. He slams the door open ready to wake them up in the most annoying way humanly possible, but the room is empty. What an odd occurrence both up and ready before he was. Of course, they left their bedroom in a terrible state, which <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> has to clean up again. It clearly annoys him, but he cleans up for them anyways, he just doesn’t want them to get hit again. It takes him a few minutes but now the mess is gone, but he notices something.<br /><br />
Isn’t it awfully quiet?<br />
After all there are fifteen other people living here as well. Confused he checks the other bedrooms. Did he miss something? Did they already leave to get the last few iron scraps from the caravan? He could not find anything unusual, except his father and mothers’ bedroom, which was utter chaos, as if a storm were raging inside. Perturbed he makes his way to the stairs and descends to the first floor. Was someone searching for money in there?  Did those misers, the caravanners try to rip of the family, increasing the metals price? <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> reaches the bottom of the stairs and is pulled out of his thoughts as he picks up on a faint smell. It is oh so familiar, yet very unpleasant. With every step he takes towards the living room, towards the dining table it gets stronger. Iron? The unease he just felt is immediately gone, now exited he takes the last few steps and turns around the corner. Standing right in front of the dining-table <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> freezes, his eyes widen in shock.<br /><br />
The whole family is gathered around the table, but no one is moving even the tiniest bit. Everyone is frozen in place. His father sitting next to the uncle, usually arguing over the most unimportant things, now sitting quietly next to each other, their faces filled with horror. <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span>s’ only grandmother, sitting there with her face distorted from disgust. His little sister, usually the purest thing in the world, frozen in place, tears rolling down her face. Cousins, aunt, grandfathers, everyone was there. <br />
But worst of all, his younger brother, the one who could always cheer Joseph up, no matter what happened, lying there on the dining table, mutilated, covered in blood, missing a few patches of flesh, as if a wild animal was feasting on him.<br /><br />
And then <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span>s mother, standing on the other side of the table, completely covered in blood, chewing on a raw piece of meat, clearly enjoying herself. The monster who caused this, undoubtedly, at this thought, <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> couldn’t hold it back anymore. He bent over and puked all over the table. After straightening up he could feel mother’s bloodshed eyes focusing on him, causing him to petrify. The mother puts on a wide and terrifying grin, as she slowly walks around the table towards him. Her eyes, resembling a hawks’ preying a mouse. As she almost reaches him, <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> panics completely, causing him to regain control over his body. He turns around and runs as fast as he possibly can. Reaching the door is the only way of escaping this mess. While running towards the entrance door he takes a deep breath and on top of his lungs he screams for help. Just shy of reaching the door <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> could hear something behind him, but almost reaching the outside he couldn’t care less. As his hand is reaching for the doorknob, he could pick up a whirling sound, followed by something heavy hitting his head. His vision started spinning, before realizing what happened, he already hit the floor. He’s desperately trying to stand up, but as he sees his mother’s grin widen even more, he loses all his strength, causing his limbs to give in. Now lying there defenselessly and defeated, he accepts his fate, tears start flowing and he starts to visibly shake. His mother moves closer clearly enjoying every moment. Reaching <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span> and overcome by insatiable hunger she throws herself onto him slashing wildly with claw like nails. Then she proceeds to rip off junks of his flesh, putting it in her mouth, gulping down each piece with great relish. Experiencing being eaten alive accompanied by agonizing pain and seeing his mother’s joy, his consciousness quickly starts to fade. The last thing he could witness before his vision completely fades. People armed with swords and spears rushing in through the front door, shoving <span title=”Joestar”>Joseph</span>s body out of the way. Then after all this his vision finally turns black.<br /><br />
