<h1>Chapter 1: The world we live in</h1>

<!---............................................ Text ................................................--->

<p class="text">
On an ominous cold morning, this little tale begins.<br />
In a small house, that could be considered fairly normal here on the outskirts of the city.
It starts here in this crappy, barely standing two-story house, where a carpenters’ family lives.
<br />
<br />
Joseph, the carpenters’ son wakes up as the first sunbeams enter through numerous cracks and holes lighting the room.
Still tired he forces himself to stand up. Unlike his siblings he has his own room, as he’s the only one with income.
In this cramped room with only enough place for a bed and dresser,he takes a sip from a small bowl filled with water,
washes himself with it and puts on a few simple clothes.
Joseph then opens the window in his room facing an alley, tosses the remaining water and covers it again. 
<br />
<br />
Time to wake up the siblings, he thinks as he enters the room next to his.
Strangely they were already up and probably downstairs.
Quite unusual as the always sleep in, but more importantly they left their window open.
Annoyed he closes it, already thinking about how to punish them, as he told them countless times already.
Looking around, it seems like he has to their room again, if he didn’t want them to get hit again.
Minutes later standing in an orderly room Joseph seems quite pleased with himself, almost forgetting he has to punish them later.
Now just as he’s leaving the room he notices something,
<br />
<br />
Isn’t it too quiet?
After all there are fifteen people living under the same roof here.
Perturbed he checks the other rooms but everyone already left.
Confused he walks down the stairs, as he asks himself, if he could maybe have missed something.
Reaching the bottom he picks up on a faint smell, the smell becomes stronger every step he takes towards the dining table.
Coming around the corner now standing right in front of the dining-table he freezes, eyes wide in shock.
<br />
<br />
The whole family is gathered but no one is moving even an inch.
The people are frozen in place, he could see his father sitting next to the uncle,
usually they would be constantly arguing over the most unimportant things,
now sitting quietly next to each other their faces filled with horror.
Joseph could see his harsh but fair grandmother sitting there with her face distorted from horror.
He could see his little sister, usually the purest thing in the world, but now frozen in place, tears rolling down her face.
<br /> 
But the worst of all, his younger brother, the one who could always cheer Joseph up no matter what happened,
lying there on the table, mutilated, covered in blood, missing e few patches of flesh, as if a wild animal was feasting on him. 
<br />
<br />
And then Josephs mother, standing on the other side of the table, completely covered in blood,
chewing on a chewy piece of meat, clearly enjoying herself.
The monster who caused this, undoubtedly, at this thought, Joseph couldn’t hold it back any more.
He bent over and puked all over the table. After straightening up he could feel mothers bloodshed eyes focusing on him,
causing him to petrify. The mother puts on a wide and terrifying grin, as she slowly walks around the table towards him.
Her eyes were resembling a hawks’ preying a mouse.
As she almost reaches him, Joseph panicked completely, causing him to regain control over his body.
He turns around and runs as fast as he possibly can.
While running towards the entrance door he takes a deep breath and on top of his lungs he screams:”Help!”.
Just shy of reaching the door Joseph could hear something behind him, but he couldn’t care less, almost there.
As his hand reaches the doorknob, he could pick up a whirling sound, followed by something heavy hitting his head.
His vision started spinning and before he could realize he hit the floor. Desperately he tries to stand up,
but as he sees his mothers grin widen even more, he looses all his strength, causing his limbs to give in.
Now lying there defenselessly and defeated, he accepts his fate, tears start flowing and he starts to visibly shake.
His mother moves closer clearly enjoying every moment. Reaching Joseph,
overcome by insatiable hunger she throws herself onto him slashing wildly with claw like nails.
Then she proceeds to take bites of his flesh.
Experiencing all this accompanied by agonizing pain his consciousness starts to fade.
The last thing he sees before his vision completely fades, people armed with swords and spears rushing in through the front door. Then after all this his vision finally turns black.
