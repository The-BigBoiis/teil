<p class="text">
On an ominous cold morning, our story begins.  <br />
In a small house, that could be considered standard here on the outskirts of the city. It starts here in this crappy, barely standing two-story house, where a carpenters’ family dwells. <br /><br />
Joseph, the carpenters’ son wakes up, as the first sunbeams enter through numerous cracks and holes lighting his room. Still tired he forces himself up. Unlike his siblings he has his own room, as he’s the oldest one, thus the family heir. In this cramped room with only enough place for a bed and dresser, he takes a sip from a small bowl filled with water, washes himself with it and puts on a few simple clothes. Joseph then opens the window, basically a hole in the wall covered by scrap wood, tosses the remaining water and covers it again. <br /><br />
Continuing his morning routine, he now has to wake up his siblings. Entering their room, he’s quite surprised, as they were already up and probably downstairs. Quite unusual, as they almost always sleep in. But more importantly they left their window open. Annoyed Joseph closes it, he told them countless times before to always close the damn thing. <br />
Now looking around, it seems like he has to fix up their mess, else they’d get hit again. Minutes later standing in an orderly room, Joseph seems quite pleased with himself, almost forgetting he has to punish them later. Just as he’s leaving the room, he notices something. <br /><br />
Isn’t it awfully quiet? <br />
After all there are fifteen people living under the same roof here. Perturbed he checks the second floor for family members, but everyone already left. Confused he descends the stairs, as he asks himself, did he miss something? Is something special going on today? Did they leave to get to the market? But why leave him behind. Reaching the ground floor Joseph could pick up on a faint smell, very familiar, yet unpleasant. Every step he takes towards the dining table it gets stronger. Blood? But why. With a bad premonition he quickly turns around the corner. Standing right in front of the dining-table he freezes, eyes wide open in shock. <br /><br />

The whole family is gathered but no one is moving even an inch. The people are frozen in place. His father sitting next to the uncle, usually arguing over the most unimportant things, now sitting quietly next to each other, their faces filled with horror. Josephs’ only grandmother, sitting there with her face distorted from disgust. His little sister, usually the purest thing in the world, frozen in place, tears rolling down her face. Cousins, aunt, grandfathers, everyone was there. <br />
But worst of all, his younger brother, the one who could always cheer Joseph up, no matter what happened, lying there on the dining table, mutilated, covered in blood, missing a few patches of flesh, as if a wild animal was feasting on him. <br /><br />
And then Josephs mother, standing on the other side of the table, completely covered in blood, chewing on a raw piece of meat, clearly enjoying herself. The monster who caused this, undoubtedly, at this thought, Joseph couldn’t hold it back anymore. He bent over and puked all over the table. After straightening up he could feel mother’s bloodshed eyes focusing on him, causing him to petrify. The mother puts on a wide and terrifying grin, as she slowly walks around the table towards him. Her eyes, resembling a hawks’ preying a mouse. As she almost reaches him, Joseph panics completely, causing him to regain control over his body. He turns around and runs as fast as he possibly can. Reaching the door is the only way of escaping this mess. While running towards the entrance door he takes a deep breath and on top of his lungs he screams for help. Just shy of reaching the door Joseph could hear something behind him, but almost reaching the outside he couldn’t care less. As his hand is reaching for the doorknob, he could pick up a whirling sound, followed by something heavy hitting his head. His vision started spinning, before realizing what happened, he already hit the floor. He’s desperately trying to stand up, but as he sees his mother’s grin widen even more, he loses all his strength, causing his limbs to give in. Now lying there defenselessly and defeated, he accepts his fate, tears start flowing and he starts to visibly shake. His mother moves closer clearly enjoying every moment. Reaching Joseph and overcome by insatiable hunger she throws herself onto him slashing wildly with claw like nails. Then she proceeds to rip off junks of his flesh, putting it in her mouth, gulping down each piece with great relish. Experiencing being eaten alive accompanied by agonizing pain and seeing his mother’s joy, his consciousness quickly starts to fade. The last thing he could witness before his vision completely fades. People armed with swords and spears rushing in through the front door, shoving Josephs body out of the way. Then after all this his vision finally turns black. 
</p>

<p class="text">
[A bit later] 
</p>

<p class="text">
People gathered around the building, most of them onlookers, some to pay their respects, some just to do their job. A priest holding a sermon, some holding the crowd at bay. A certain man pushes through the crowd, impolitely shoving people aside. As the woman could see him, she started waving.
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker">-</p>    <p class="speach">“Isaac!”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
The man walking straight towards her pushed the last guy out of his way. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Hey Olivia, so what’s going on?”</p>
    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p>  <p class="speach">“We have 3 people dead, the rest still petrified, probably a contained outbreak.”</p>
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Yeah, was already wondering, when the next one would happen. Just guide me to the scene.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Entering the building, they were immediately greeted by the stench of blood and vomit. Isaac takes out a handkerchief and covers his mouth and nose. He proceeds to check the scene, a young man lying next to the door, dead, his body in a miserable condition, a woman covered in blood lying on the floor, beheaded and clearly the one responsible for this mess. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>   <p class="speach">“A damn shame, looks like the boy could recover from the shock in time. Would have made for an excellent guard.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“His name is Joseph. According to the people outside at the time, he could even scream for help.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Order someone to take in his corpse, also don’t forget the woman.”
</p>
</div>
<p class="text">
Isaac continued. Inspecting the scene at the dinner table. Everyone still frozen in place, almost as if time stopped. Inspecting each person individually he starts with Josephs father. He begins with checking for a pulse, breath and other signs of life. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“What can you tell me about this man?”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“He seems to be a well-known carpenter around here, yet not really able to secure large amounts of money. He and his family are well respected around here, as they often help out for almost free.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“What’s wrong?”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“A bit disappointing, let’s just get through with the others.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Understood. The next man is his brother, working where he can, but barely earning enough to provide for himself. He’s known for being the less successful one.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
After checking for any signs of life, Isaac continues to the grandmother. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“No reason to waste time on her, just declare her death.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Then he checks Josephs little sister. Again, looking for signs of life, he immediately gets absorbed in his thoughts. After a few seconds he checks the little girls face, having made up his mind about something. He raises his hand and with all his strength he slaps her face. After waiting a few moments without perceiving any signs of movement he sighs. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Olivia, pay attention to this child, if she wakes up get her out of here, if not… <br />
Let her be. The others aren’t worth inspecting, if one wakes up, lucky, if not, whatever. I’m now going to inspect the rest of the house, so you’re free to do your job.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
He then goes into the kitchen. Besides somewhat nice furniture, he couldn’t find anything useful or worth anything. Searching through the drawers, he eventually comes across a small knife made of iron. He takes it and silently puts it away in his pocket. Everything else is just worthless junk consisting of some clay pots, some dirty and worn cloths and eating utensils. <br /><br />
Isaac returns to the now busy Olivia ordering her underlings around. </p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>   <p class="speach">“The kitchen’s fine, take everything you deem useful.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Isaac goes up the stairs and looks around a bit but couldn’t find anything worth at least some coins. After checking every room, the most significant thing he could find was a poorly made plush in the kids’ bedroom. But still having to check the woman’s room, he had his hopes up. He enters into a mess of a habitable room. Imagining the order of events Isaac figured, she probably woke up after the others, messed up the room for some reason and went downstairs for her feast. Trusting his gut feeling he starts searching around. After almost half an hour he could confirm his suspicion. He found it, a small translucent stone.
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“You are quite the rare one, ain’t ya?”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Taking the stone, shaped like a perfect cube, small enough to fit in his palm, he puts it in a small bag and hides it in his pocket.  <br />
Now finished with his task he goes downstairs to Olivia. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“My job’s done. Try to salvage everything you can, then burn this damn building down.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p>	<p class="speach">“What about the people?”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“If no one recovers in time just let them sit there and burn to ashes. Hahaha, may their souls rest in peace, as the church would say.”</p>
