<p class="text">
On this ominous, cold and dark morning, a young man’s tragic destiny unfolds. In a small town encircled by its walls, protected from the outside world, stands a house on the city’s outskirts. In that cheap, barely standing two-story house, Joseph, a novice carpenter lives with his family. He begins his day, waking up in his small bedroom with barely enough place for his bed and dresser. The room slowly brightens, as the first sunbeams enter through numerous cracks and holes, Joseph gave up on fixing a long time ago.<br /><br />
He calmly does his morning routine, still freezing from the coldness the night brought. He picks up a bowl, filled with fresh water from a nearby well, takes a sip, then washes himself with it. Joseph opens the only ‘window’ in his room, a big hole in the wall covered by scrap wood, a wave of light floods the room blinding Joseph for a moment. Causing him to sneeze and almost spill the water, after regaining his composure he tosses the remaining bit out of the window. After placing the bowl on the dresser and putting on some simple clothes he completes his morning routine. About to exit his room a smile forms on Josephs face, as he remembers, today he finally gets his first set of metal tools.<br /><br />
He knocks on the door next to his. No response. Just as he expected, his younger siblings always sleep in. He slams the door open, preparing himself to wake them up in the most annoying way humanly possible, but the room is empty. What an odd occurrence, both of them up and ready before he was. Of course, they left their bedroom in a terrible state, which Joseph has to clean up again. It clearly annoys him, but he cleans up for them anyways, or else they would get hit again. It takes him a few minutes, the mess is gone, but he notices something.<br /><br />
Isn’t it awfully quiet?<br />
After all, there are fifteen other people living here as well. Confused he checks the other bedrooms. Did he miss something? Did they already leave to get the last few iron scraps from the caravan? He could not find anything unusual, except his father and mothers’ bedroom, which was utter chaos, as if a storm has been raging inside. Perturbed he makes his way to the stairs and descends to the first floor. Was someone searching for money in there?  Did those misers, the caravanners, try to rip off the family, increasing the metals price? Joseph reaches the bottom of the stairs and is pulled out of his thoughts as he picks up on a faint smell. It is oh so familiar, yet very unpleasant. With every step he takes towards the living room, towards the dining table, it gets stronger. Iron? The unease he just felt is immediately gone, now excited he takes the last few steps and turns around the corner. Standing right in front of the dining-table, he freezes, his eyes widen in shock.<br /><br />
The whole family is gathered around the table, but no one is moving even the tiniest bit. Everyone is frozen in place. His father sitting next to the uncle, always arguing over the most unimportant things, now sitting quietly next to each other, their faces filled with horror. Josephs’ only grandmother, sitting there with her face distorted from disgust. His little sister, usually the purest thing in the world, frozen in place, tears rolling down her face. Cousins, aunt, grandfathers, everyone was there.<br />
But worst of all, his younger brother, the one who could always cheer Joseph up, no matter what happened, lying there on the dining table, mutilated, covered in blood, missing a few patches of flesh, as if a wild animal was feasting on him.<br /><br />
And then Josephs mother, standing on the other side of the table, completely covered in blood, chewing on a raw piece of meat, clearly enjoying herself. The monster who caused this. Undoubtedly. Witnessing this scene, Joseph could not hold it back. He bent over and puked all over the table. After straightening up he could feel mother’s bloodshed eyes focusing on him, causing him to petrify. The mother puts on a wide and terrifying grin, as she slowly walks around the table towards him. Her eyes, resembling a hawks’ preying a mouse. As she is only an arms width away, Joseph completely panics, causing him to regain control over his body. He turns around and runs as fast as he possibly can, putting as much strength as he can in each step. He figures, the only way of escaping this mess would be running away. While running towards the buildings’ entrance door he takes a deep breath and on top of his lungs he screams for help. After a few moments that felt like hours, just shy of reaching the door Joseph could hear something behind him. As his hand is reaching for the doorknob, he could pick up on a whirling sound coming from behind, followed by something heavy hitting his head. His vision started spinning, before realizing what happened, he already hit the floor. He tries desperately to stand up, but as he sees his mother’s grin widen even more, he loses all his strength, causing his limbs to give in. Now lying there defenselessly and defeated in front of the door, preyed upon by his mother, he can only accept his fate, his tears start flowing and he starts to visibly shake. His mother slowly moves closer, clearly enjoying every moment. Reaching Joseph and overcome by insatiable hunger, she throws herself onto him, slashing wildly with her claw like nails. She then rips off pieces of his flesh, putting them in her mouth, gulping down each chunk of meat with great relish. Experiencing being eaten alive accompanied by agonizing pain and seeing his mother’s joy, his consciousness quickly starts to fade. The last thing he can witness before his vision completely vanishes. People armed with swords and spears rushing in through the front door, in the process of doing so shoving Josephs body out of the way. Then after all this his vision finally turns black.<br /><br />
