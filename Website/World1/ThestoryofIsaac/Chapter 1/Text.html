<p class="text">
On this ominous, cold and dark morning, a young man’s tragic destiny unfolds. In a small town encircled by its walls, protected from the outside world, stands a house on the city’s outskirts. In that cheap, barely standing, two-story house, Joseph, a novice carpenter lives with his family. He begins his day, waking up in his small bedroom with barely enough place for his bed and dresser. The room slowly brightens, as the first sunbeams enter through numerous cracks and holes, Joseph gave up on fixing a long time ago. <br /><br />
He calmly does his morning routine, still freezing from coldness, the night brought about. He picks up a bowl, filled with fresh water from a nearby well, takes a sip, then washes himself with it. Joseph opens the only ‘window’ in his room, a big hole in the wall covered by scrap wood, a wave of light floods the room blinding Joseph for a moment. Causing him to sneeze and almost spill the remaining water, after regaining his composure he tosses the water out of the window. After placing the bowl on the dresser and putting on some simple clothes he completes his morning routine. About to exit his room a smile forms on Josephs face, as he remembers, today he finally gets his first set of metal tools. <br /><br /> 
He knocks on the door next to his. No response. Nothing unusual, as his younger siblings always sleep in. Thus, he slams the door open, preparing himself to wake them up in the most annoying way humanly possible. Their room however is completely empty, disregarding the mess they left behind. What an odd occurrence, both of them up and ready, before he himself was. It clearly annoys him, but he cleans up for them, as they’d get hit again if he didn’t. It takes him a few minutes, the mess is gone, but he notices something. <br /><br />
Isn’t it awfully quiet? <br /><br />
After all, fifteen people live here under the same roof. Confused he checks the other bedrooms. Did he miss something? Did they already leave to get the last few iron scraps from the caravan? He could not find anything unusual, except his father and mothers’ bedroom, which was utter chaos, as if a storm has been raging inside. Perturbed he makes his way to the stairs and descends to the first floor. Did those misers, the ‘caravanners’ (placeholder for another term I’ve not yet come up with), try to rip off the family, increasing the metal’s price? Causing his parents to search for money in there? Joseph reaches the bottom of the stairs, gets pulled out of his thoughts, as he picks up on a faint smell. It is oh so familiar, yet very unpleasant. With every step he takes towards the living room, towards the dining table, it gets stronger. Iron? The confusion he just felt is immediately gone, now getting more and more excited he takes the last few steps and turns around the corner. Standing right in front of the dining-table, he freezes, his eyes widen in shock. <br /><br />
The whole family is gathered around the table, but no one is moving even the tiniest bit, everyone frozen in place. His father sits next to the uncle, they would always argue over the most unimportant things, now they just quietly sit next to each other, their faces filled with horror. Josephs’ only grandmother, seated there with her face distorted from disgust. His little sister, usually the purest being in the entire world, frozen in place, tears rolling down her face. His cousins, his aunt, both of his grandfathers, everyone was gathered there. <br /><br />
But worst of all, his younger brother, the one who could always cheer Joseph up, no matter what happened. Lying on the dining table, lifeless, covered in his own blood, his body is hovered by deep cuts. The scene so surreal and brutal, it looked like a wild animal was feasting on him and mutilated this innocent child. <br /><br />
And last but not least, Josephs mother, standing on the other side of the table, completely covered in blood, chewing on a raw piece of meat, clearly enjoying herself. The monster who caused this. Undoubtedly. Witnessing this scene, Joseph could not hold it back. He bent over and puked all over the table. <br />
After straightening back up, he could feel his mother’s bloodshed eyes focusing on him, causing him to petrify. The monster, his mother, puts on a wide and terrifying grin, as she slowly walks around the table towards Joseph. Her eyes, resembling a hawks’ preying a mouse. As she is only an arms width away, Joseph completely panics, causing him to regain control over his body. He turns around and runs as fast as he possibly can, putting as much strength as he can in each step. <br />
His only chance of survival, is to run, running with all his might. As he runs for his life towards the front door, he takes a deep breath and on top of his lungs he screams for help. After a few moments that felt like minutes, just shy of reaching the door Joseph could hear a roar coming from behind him. As his hand is reaching for the doorknob, he could pick up on a whirling sound coming towards him, followed by something heavy hitting his head. His vision started spinning, before realizing what happened, he already hit the floor. Joseph tries desperately to stand up, but as he sees his mother’s grin widen even more, he loses all his strength, causing his limbs to give in. Now lying there defenselessly and defeated in front of the door, preyed upon by his own mother, he can only accept his miserable fate, he starts to visibly shake, and tears start flowing. His mother slowly moves closer, clearly enjoying every moment. Reaching Joseph and overcome by insatiable hunger, she throws herself onto him, slashing wildly with her claw like nails. She then rips off pieces of his flesh from his arms, legs, stomach, anything her arms could reach. Gulping down each chunk of meat with great relish. Experiencing being eaten alive accompanied by agonizing pain and seeing his mother’s joy in torturing him, his consciousness quickly starts to fade. The last thing he can witness before his vision completely turns black. People armed with swords and spears rushing in through the front door, in the process of doing so shoving Josephs body out of the way. Then after all this his consciousness vanishes.
