<h1>Chapter 1: The world we live in</h1>

<!---............................................ Text ................................................--->

<p class="text">
Today is just another day of slaughter in this hellish world tormenting every being resigning on it. Especially humans are prone to struggling, dying left and right. Only living for the next day to come, surviving, fighting, until one day death catches up and nothing is left behind. This gruesome world won’t allow for humans to thrive, as everyone is struggling.
<br />
<br />
Here in this world where humans are not allowed to thrive this lost and forgotten story begins. To be more precise, it starts in a small town in midst all this madness. 
<br />
<br />
Getting closer towards the city one would see endless fields of gold and brown. Cultivated land, yet not one person cultivating it. Staying motionless and eerily quiet, only to be interrupted by a sparse gust of wind. Moving further towards the town the walls would eventually come to sight, battered yet imposing and unyielding. Once one passes the gates, that are barely wide enough for two to pass at the same time, people will finally come in sight. The expectation of a lively bustling city one might have had, easily crushed. Few people are traversing the streets and those who are, are overly cautious and weary. Now passing by all those shabby houses, one could wonder how they are even standing. Getting closer to the center the streets get busier, there are even a few children playing on the streets. While the general quality of the housing does not improve, there seem to be more houses that are actually nice to look at, which seems very odd considering the general wealth this town has. Passing more buildings one would eventually arrive at the center. Here it is, one of the very few reasons to come to this city. A huge building, the main church of magic. Completely made of stone, with built in windows. So Beautiful and imposing, one would ask themselves how come such a thing, worthy of being called a world wonder, would reside in such a run-down city.
<br />
<br />
Here on a an ominous cold morning, the tale begins. Hovering over the city gloomy dark clouds. In a small barely standing two-story house on the outskirts of the city,living in his family’s house Joseph wakes up. Now sitting in his shabby cheap utilitarian furnished room, he notices himself shaking from the cold. Knowing the consequences of getting sick he hurries up and gets his clothes on. Opening the window, basically a hole in the wall covered by a plank of scrap wood. Opening said window freezing cold air streams inside, such a weird thing happening in late spring, giving him a bad feeling. He quickly closes the “window” and exits his room. Now noticing how quiet it is he gets visibly confused, he lives with his whole family after all. 
<br />
<br />
Something’s wrong.
<br />
<br />
Going to his younger siblings room, they always sleep in those little shits. After entering the room, he is confused, no ones here. And they forgot to close the window. Now completely forgetting his weariness only wanting to scold those fuckers he rushes out the room and down the stairs, only slowing down after noticing his mother standing alone in the kitchen. 
<br />
<br />
Something’s off. Before he could do or say something, the figure in front of him turns around. He completely freezes, his mother is, completely covered in blood. Only now does Joseph spot all the family members’ corpses lying around mutilated, their shock still resigning in their faces. On the dining table Josephs younger brother, barely recognizable missing some of his limbs. Looking at his mother his eyes widen, she stands there with a wide horrible grin, bloodshed eyes, looking lustfully at him. She starts slowly walking towards him blood dripping from her hands, clearly not her own. Now completely panicking Joseph regains control over his body he turns around and runs with all his might. He takes a deep breath and on top of his lungs he screams: “GHOUL!”. Just shy of reaching a window and jumping out, he experiences a unbelievably strong force pushing him to the ground. Scared to death he turns around and tries to stand up, but seeing his mother’s grin his legs give in. He falls on his back hitting his head. Now lying there defenselessly accepting his gruesome fate tears start flowing and he starts visibly shaking. Enjoying his pathetic sight the grin seems to widen even more, she throws herself onto Joseph. She begins to wildly slash with her claw like nails, removing his clothes while leaving deep cuts in his flesh. His mother proceeds to pulling out his organs and splattering them everywhere. Seeing this accompanied by agonizing pain he starts to loose his consciousness. The last thing he sees before his vision completely fades is shapes of people armed with swords and spears rushing in through the front door.
