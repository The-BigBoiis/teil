<h1>Chap 2</h1>


<p class="text"> On his way back to report, Isaac came across the market place. Usually it wouldn’t bother him, however today the whole place was crowded, he totally forgot that a caravan was residing near the palace. It actually is quite a big event, as its the only way to get materials from the outside. Being the only source they sell their stuff for a huge profit, at the same time purchasing supplies in bulk. Probably not the best time to sell the knife he thinks, once they left and people are yearning for metal, that would result in a nice amount. <br />
Isaac looks up in the sky, noon, having to rush in the morning without eating something really sucks. He checks his surroundings and immediately spots his favorite tavern without too much trouble. Inside a grumpy old man spots him, the tavern keeper. </p>

<div class="spoken">

<p class="speaker"> Sam: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Oi, Isaac you here at this time?” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Had to do something on the outer city. Have not eaten yet, so just give me something good.” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Sam: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “For a miser like you? I have some cold porridge left over, anything else and you have to pay for it” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “You’re gonna let a Samaritan like me starve? Even though I work for the church for free?” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Sam: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Stop playing the innocent man you’re clearly not. Now order your food like anyone else.” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “As expected not letting a single soul squeeze any money. Just give me whatever you have lying around for a fair price and as usual a cup of ale.” </p>

</div>

<p class="text"> Taking his time to eat his piece of dry old bread with a lukewarm vegetable soup, chatting with his old friend Sam.  As tome passes he finishes his meal and leaves, after all he still has to report.<br />
Stepping outside, he squints his eyes in reaction to the blinding sun, sneezes and takes a few moments to adapt. Now looking in the direction he came from seeing a pillar of smoke rising in the distance. He  
leisurely walks to the center of the city, passing the palace that would be best described by one word, ‘pathetic’. This city could by no means considered wealthy, but still, they didn’t even try to put on a facade. Looking closely at the palace it really is a disappointment. Passing the few guards that were guarding the place all Isaac could do is shake his head. </p>

<div class="spoken">

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> -At least they’re not trying to hide that the king is the churches puppet? </p>

</div>

<p class="text"> <br />
Isaac arrives at his destination, standing on a large empty space in front of the cathedral. It is a marvelous and majestic building completely made of limestone, in midst the city. The disparity of quality compared to anything in this town, makes the change of scenery feel like entering another world. Isaac walks towards the entrance, which is to each sides, left and right protected by a tower so tall it could reach the sky. The scale of this monument alone is reason enough to make any other building of the church obsolete. </p>

<p class="text"> After entering he’s immediately greeted by a young priest. </p>

<div class="spoken">

<p class="speaker"> Priest: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Welcome back, prosecutor Isaac. If you’re coming to report, Jonas is already waiting, he seems a little impatient.”

</div>

<p class="text"> Isaac walks through the enormous main hall, the place where at almost any time of the day you’d hear a preacher holding a sermon. Even now. </p>

<div class="spoken">

<p class="speaker"> Preacher: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “… To persist is our destiny, fight for yourself, your family and the community, as we are the ones to prove ourselves worthy in the eyes of the lord. And never ever forget, do not let magic corrupt you, as the lord will not forgive those submitting to the forces of evil.” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Preacher: </p>
	<p class="speach"> 	“Our Lord residing in the void,<br />
		hallowed be your name,<br />
		Your Kingdom come,<br />
		Your will be done,<br />
		<br />
		Give us today our daily bread.<br />
		And forgive our sins,<br />
		as we fight and survive in your name.<br />
		Lead us not into temptation,<br />
		but deliver us from evil.<br />
		For the kingdom, the power<br />
		and the glory are yours<br />
		now and forever.<br />
		<br />
		Amen.” </p>

</div>

<p class="text"> Isaac, numb to the preaching, from having herd the same thing for hundreds of times, passed through the hall. Standing in front a inconspicuous door, bracing himself for what might come he knocks. </p>

<div class="spoken">

<p class="speaker"> – </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Come in.” </p>

</div>

<p class="text"> The room Isaac enters is a small office, a window on the opposite site, a bookshelf to the site, at the center a large table with various things on it. Behind the desk sits an elderly man with gray hair and a somewhat trimmed long beard covering the lower half of the face. Isaac takes a seat now sitting directly across the table. </p>

<div class="spoken">

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “<span title=Get it? The reference? Jonas Brothers?>Brother Jonas</span>, you look good today, heard you expected me?” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Jonas: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Oh come on, you can’t fool me, your body doesn’t lie. You did something awful, didn’t you? And you took so long, I was wondering if something happened. Then looking out the window I could see smoke rise in the city, oddly enough it was exactly in the direction I sent you this morning. Do you have to say something?” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “I don’t know what you mean, I just did the job and got something to eat at Sam’s.” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Jonas: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Cut the crap, you can’t go all around the city burning down buildings and killing people. Isaac, why do you always cause more trouble than you resolve? Argh, you constantly cause me headache.” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “You know full well, I’m following the instructions. The house was in a terrible condition at best and don’t blame me if the instructors say we should get rid of burdensome people. The person most familiar with it would most certainly be you, you know that after recovering from shock they would suffer from a trauma. Didn’t something similar happen to your wife? And who would care anyways?” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Jonas: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Please don’t bring that up. You should know that I don’t care about the deaths, but what about the workers, what would they think from the church. Haaa … <br />
I’d love to punish you now, but I have to send you off to the next mission.”

<p class="speaker"> Isaac: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “Thank god, but already? I still have to drop off ...” </p>

<p class="speaker"> Jonas: </p>
	<p class="speach"> “I don’t care, just focus on the task. Seems to be something serious, as the higher ups themselves asked for you. I’m not sure what it is about, all I know is, it concerns something outside the city walls. Now stop wasting my time, leave.” </p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="text">

<p class="text"> While the house Isaac lives in may not be the best one, at least it wouldn’t spontaneously collapse. He lives with  a few random people, not family and has his own bedroom with a desk. There he opens the letter. Reading definitely not his forte, so it took him a while to understand the content. </p>

<p class="speaker"> Summary </p>
	<p class="speach"> Some signs we picked up on, could indicate something big happening soon. All we definitely know is that it has something to do with the mountain. There might be some connection to the great calamity. So we need some people to investigate. As raising and mobilizing an armed force would take to much time, we are sending multiple Investigators separately, to maximize chance of arrival. As each city has to at least send someone, you were selected. Arrangements with the travelers guild are already made, you will leave tomorrow morning. You have to make your own preparations today. You’re expected to be at the market place before sunrise, fully equipped to survive in the wilderness. More instructions will be given before departure. <br />
This message is fully confidential, burn the letter after reading. </p>

<div class="spoken">

<p class="speaker"> Isaac </p>
	<p class="speach"> Well shit, that's not what I expected. </p>
