[A bit later] 
</p>

<p class="text">
People gathered around the building, most of them onlookers, some to pay their respects, some just to do their job. A priest holding a sermon, some holding the crowd at bay. A certain man pushes through the crowd, impolitely shoving people aside. As the woman could see him, she started waving.
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker">-</p>    <p class="speach">“Isaac!”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
The man walking straight towards her pushed the last guy out of his way. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Hey Olivia, so what’s going on?”</p>
    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p>  <p class="speach">“We have 3 people dead, the rest still petrified, probably a contained outbreak.”</p>
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Yeah, was already wondering, when the next one would happen. Just guide me to the scene.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Entering the building, they were immediately greeted by the stench of blood and vomit. Isaac takes out a handkerchief and covers his mouth and nose. He proceeds to check the scene, a young man lying next to the door, dead, his body in a miserable condition, a woman covered in blood lying on the floor, beheaded and clearly the one responsible for this mess. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>   <p class="speach">“A damn shame, looks like the boy could recover from the shock in time. Would have made for an excellent guard.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“His name is Joseph. According to the people outside at the time, he could even scream for help.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Order someone to take in his corpse, also don’t forget the woman.”
</p>
</div>
<p class="text">
Isaac continued. Inspecting the scene at the dinner table. Everyone still frozen in place, almost as if time stopped. Inspecting each person individually he starts with Josephs father. He begins with checking for a pulse, breath and other signs of life. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“What can you tell me about this man?”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“He seems to be a well-known carpenter around here, yet not really able to secure large amounts of money. He and his family are well respected around here, as they often help out for almost free.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Hmm…”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“What’s wrong?”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“A bit disappointing, let’s just get through with the others.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Understood. The next man is his brother, working where he can, but barely earning enough to provide for himself. He’s known for being the less successful one.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
After checking for any signs of life, Isaac continues to the grandmother. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“No reason to waste time on her, just declare her death.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Then he checks Josephs little sister. Again, looking for signs of life, he immediately gets absorbed in his thoughts. After a few seconds he checks the little girls face, having made up his mind about something. He raises his hand and with all his strength he slaps her face. After waiting a few moments without perceiving any signs of movement he sighs. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p> 	<p class="speach">“Olivia, pay attention to this child, if she wakes up get her out of here, if not… <br />
Let her be. The others aren’t worth inspecting, if one wakes up, lucky, if not, whatever. I’m now going to inspect the rest of the house, so you’re free to do your job.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
He then goes into the kitchen. Besides somewhat nice furniture, he couldn’t find anything useful or worth anything. Searching through the drawers, he eventually comes across a small knife made of iron. He takes it and silently puts it away in his pocket. Everything else is just worthless junk consisting of some clay pots, some dirty and worn cloths and eating utensils. <br /><br />
Isaac returns to the now busy Olivia ordering her underlings around. </p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>   <p class="speach">“The kitchen’s fine, take everything you deem useful.”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Isaac goes up the stairs and looks around a bit but couldn’t find anything worth at least some coins. After checking every room, the most significant thing he could find was a poorly made plush in the kids’ bedroom. But still having to check the woman’s room, he had his hopes up. He enters into a mess of a habitable room. Imagining the order of events Isaac figured, she probably woke up after the others, messed up the room for some reason and went downstairs for her feast. Trusting his gut feeling he starts searching around. After almost half an hour he could confirm his suspicion. He found it, a small translucent stone.
</p>

<div class="spoken">
    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“You are quite the rare one, ain’t ya?”</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
Taking the stone, shaped like a perfect cube, small enough to fit in his palm, he puts it in a small bag and hides it in his pocket.  <br />
Now finished with his task he goes downstairs to Olivia. 
</p>

<div class="spoken">

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“My job’s done. Try to salvage everything you can, then burn this damn building down.”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Olivia:</p>	<p class="speach">“What about the people?”</p>

    <p class="speaker"> Isaac:</p>	<p class="speach">“If no one recovers in time just let them sit there and burn to ashes. Hahaha, may their souls rest in peace, as the church would say.”</p>
