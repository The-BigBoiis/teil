<h1>Chapter 0: The Mountain</h1>

<!---............................................ Text ................................................--->

<p class="text">
In midst of the continent the mountain towers over anything.
So monumental, even all clouds are left behind.
So tall not even snow is able to reach the top.
A rocky place where the sun always shines.
Devoid of all life and motion, unbelievably beautiful and peaceful.
Not a single sound disrupting the peace.
It seems like time has stopped in this place. 
<br />
<br />
A man heavily breathing, slowly ascends the mountain.
Reaching after a tube exiting his backpack his body relaxes being able to take a few breaths.
He pushes forward.
He motivates himself as his tired body, desperately wishing for rest.
The man not wavering the tiniest bit, getting closer to the mountain top step by step.
He knows he reached his limit days ago, he has long exceeded what could be considered humanly possible.
But he knows he can not fail.
He must not fail.
<br />
<br />
Hours pass, yet time doesn’t seem to move.
Then as the man looks up to the top he sees the peak.
Suffering and pain he endured for days made sense again.
He felt a new wave of energy rise in him.
he would have run up there if his body wasn't in such a sorry state.
Continuing his fight against his own body he proceeds to climb the mountain.
With only a few steps between him and the top he couldn’t fail now.
While this journey unimaginably impressive, it still is only a means to an end. He has to finish his task.
He arrives at his destination, standing at the top of the world.
He lets his backpack slide down his shoulders.
He slowly descends onto his knees.
He hasn’t much time left. He pulls out a small stone and puts down the stone right at the peak.
Now having fulfilled his task he truly realizes in what state his body is.
Having held his breath for so long he experiences dizziness.
But he can’t breathe he mustn't fall for temptation.
He grabs his bag and throws it away.
As far as possible.
Now struggling for the last time, the man slowly looses his consciousness.
The scene returns to a stand still.
<br />
<br />
On the Mountain so monumental, all clouds are left behind.
So tall not even snow is able to reach the top.
A rocky place where the sun always shines.
Devoid of all life and motion, unbelievably beautiful and peaceful.
Not a single sound disrupting the peace.
There lies a man, motionless and timeless, next to him a stone emitting a faint yellow glow.
