<p class="text">
In midst of the continent there stands a colossal mountain towering over anything. So monumental, all clouds are left behind. So tall, the top not once experienced the fall of snow. A rocky place where the sun always shines. Devoid of all life and motion, standing still for all eternity, yet unbelievably beautiful and peaceful. Not a single sound would dare to disrupt the peace. The flow of time seems to have stopped. 
</p>
    
<p class="text">
A man heavily breathing, slowly ascends the mountain. He has endured so many hardships, to come this far. Against all odds and reason, fighting his aching body, he steadily advances. At one point he seems to slow down, starting to heavily gasp for air. The man calmly reaches after a bag hanging on the side of his backpack. Opening the small bag, he covers his mouth with it, after taking a few breaths he starts to hyperventilate. After experiencing pain, bordering at torture, able to break oneâ€™s mind, he continues. He pushes forward, as his tired body, desperately wishes for rest. The man not wavering the tiniest bit, step by step, slowly gets closer to the mountain top. He knows he reached his limit days ago; he has long exceeded what could be considered humanly possible. But now is not the time to fail. 
</p>
    
<p class="text">
Almost reaching the peak the man experiences immense joy. Finally, his journey would end, he would be freed from this torture. All the suffering and pain, he endured for this long, made sense again. He felt a new wave of energy rise in him. He would have run the last few meters if his body were not in such a sorry state. Continuing his fight against his own limitations he reaches the top. He lets his backpack slide down his shoulders. He slowly descends onto his knees, thanking the lord for lending him the power needed for this trip. He looks at the world beneath him, realizing how grand the task, he just accomplished, was. Now checking the plains, he was so familiar with from this distance, his mood drops immediately, the suspicions came true after all. He takes a seat and patiently waits for the night to come. <br />
After nightfall, he calmly stands up, grabs a small translucent stone, inside his backpack. He sighs, tightens the grip on the stone inside his palm. With all his determination he holds it as high in the sky as possible. Soon the stone begins to shine in a warm and calming light. The intensity ever increasing, until at some point it became as bright as the sun, turning the deepest night into day. For a few moments it looked like the day would suddenly return. The new sun in the skies, almost instantly begins to fade out. With the night returning the man collapses.

In midst the darkness there stands a Mountain so monumental, all clouds are left behind. So tall not even snow is able to reach the top. A rocky place where the sun always shines. Devoid of all life and motion, unbelievably beautiful and peaceful. There lies a man, motionless and timeless, next to him a stone emitting a faint yellow glow.
